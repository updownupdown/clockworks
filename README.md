# Clockworks

This is a hobby project to mess around with spinning gears, gear ratios, pendulums, etc.

## To-do

- Improve tolerance math, UI
- Add actual vs. gear time
- Tooltips for buttons
- Dials for hands
- Ability to adjust initial rotation of hands
- If no local storage, show brief tutorial, or allow selection from preset, start from scratch, etc.
- Help modal
- Ability to set gear parent

## Bugs

- Adding/deleting gears doesn't always work well, need to test more extensively
