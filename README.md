# Clockworks

This is a hobby project to mess around with spinning gears, gear ratios, pendulums, etc.

## To-do

- Ability to adjust initial rotation of hands
- Dials for hands
- Save to localstorage (persist state on reload)
- Improve tolerance math, UI

## Bugs

- Adding/deleting gears doesn't always work well
- Moving gears around doesn't account for gear forks, and doesn't always go to proper parent
