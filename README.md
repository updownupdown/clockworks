# Clockworks

This is a hobby project to mess around with spinning gears, gear ratios, pendulums, etc.

## To-do

- Use context?
- Ability to adjust initial rotation of hands
- Dials for hands
- Reset gears
- Pick from various presets
- Export/import, save to localstorate

## Bugs

- Adding gears work well
- Moving gears around doesn't account for gear forks, and doesn't always go to proper parent
