This is a hobby project to mess around with spinning gears, gear ratios, pendulums, etc.

## To-do

- Dials for hands
- Ability to set gear parent
- Add actual vs. gear time
- Ability to adjust initial rotation of hands

## Bugs

- Adding/deleting gears doesn't always work well, need to test more extensively
