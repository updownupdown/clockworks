# Clockworks

This is a hobby project to mess around with spinning gears, gear ratios, pendulums, etc.

The goal of this web app is to build a clock. This is achieved by connecting gears together, achieving various gear size ratios, and adding clock hands to certain gears in order to have the clock hands rotating at the right speeds.

You will need to chain several gears together, using different sized gears, either side by side or fixed on top of one another, to convert a quickly rotating gear (i.e. 1 rotation per minute) to a slowly rotating gear (i.e. 1 rotation per hour, 1 rotation every 12 hours, etc.), step by step. The gauges and table will help you find the right gear ratios.

You can also load a preset from the sidebar to help you visualize the end goal. Your work will be saved in your browser's local storage and will persist across reload. You can also import and export your work as a JSON file.

## To-do

- Add dials for hands
- Fix/improve sidebar clock
- Add ability to adjust initial rotation of hands
- Add gear "cut-outs" (6 holes similar to read clock gears)
